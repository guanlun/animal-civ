## Brainstorming
Research: Individual buildings research different technologies?
Have a few mutually exclusive branches of technologies to research for each building. Once you go down to one path you cannot get technologies of another path.

Map generation: Just generate a large square map (e.g. 33x33 or 65x65) and interpolate the hex grid so that we can have arbitrary map sizes.
