## Brainstorming
Research: Individual buildings research different technologies?
Have a few mutually exclusive branches of technologies to research for each building. Once you go down to one path you cannot get technologies of another path.

### UI
When each turn ends, play an animation of resource gathering - each tile moves resource to building, building moves resource to the UI text.
